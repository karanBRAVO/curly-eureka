## Feature Extraction from Images

In this hackathon, the goal is to create a machine learning model that extracts entity values from images. This capability is crucial in fields like healthcare, e-commerce, and content moderation, where precise product information is vital. As digital marketplaces expand, many products lack detailed textual descriptions, making it essential to obtain key details directly from images. These images provide important information such as weight, volume, voltage, wattage, dimensions, and many more, which are critical for digital stores.

### Data Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. **index:** An unique identifier (ID) for the data sample
2. **image_link**: Public URL where the product image is available for download. Example link - <https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XfHPR36-L.jpg>
    To download images use `download_images` function from `src/utils.py`. See sample code in `src/test.ipynb`.
3. **group_id**: Category code of the product
4. **entity_name:** Product entity name. For eg: “item_weight”
5. **entity_value:** Product entity value. For eg: “34 gram”
    Note: For test.csv, you will not see the column `entity_value` as it is the target variable.

### Output Format

The output file should be a csv with 2 columns:

1. **index:** The unique identifier (ID) of the data sample. Note the index should match the test record index.
2. **prediction:** A string which should have the following format: “x unit” where x is a float number in standard formatting and unit is one of the allowed units (allowed units are mentioned in the Appendix). The two values should be concatenated and have a space between them. For eg: “2 gram”, “12.5 centimetre”, “2.56 ounce” are valid. Few invalid cases: “2 gms”, “60 ounce/1.7 kilogram”, “2.2e2 kilogram” etc.
    Note: Make sure to output a prediction for all indices. If no value is found in the image for any test sample, return empty string, i.e, `“”`. If you have less/more number of output samples in the output file as compared to test.csv, your output won’t be evaluated.

### File Descriptions

*source files*

1. **src/sanity.py**: Sanity checker to ensure that the final output file passes all formatting checks. Note: the script will not check if less/more number of predictions are present compared to the test file. See sample code in `src/test.ipynb`
2. **src/utils.py**: Contains helper functions for downloading images from the image_link.
3. **src/constants.py:** Contains the allowed units for each entity type.
4. **sample_code.py:** We also provided a sample dummy code that can generate an output file in the given format. Usage of this file is optional.

*Dataset files*

1. **dataset/train.csv**: Training file with labels (`entity_value`).
2. **dataset/test.csv**: Test file without output labels (`entity_value`). Generate predictions using your model/solution on this file's data and format the output file to match sample_test_out.csv (Refer the above section "Output Format")
3. **dataset/sample_test.csv**: Sample test input file.
4. **dataset/sample_test_out.csv**: Sample outputs for sample_test.csv. The output for test.csv must be formatted in the exact same way. Note: The predictions in the file might not be correct

### Constraints

1. You will be provided with a sample output file and a sanity checker file. Format your output to match the sample output file exactly and pass it through the sanity checker to ensure its validity. Note: If the file does not pass through the sanity checker, it will not be evaluated. You should recieve a message like `Parsing successfull for file: ...csv` if the output file is correctly formatted.

2. You are given the list of allowed units in constants.py and also in Appendix. Your outputs must be in these units. Predictions using any other units will be considered invalid during validation.

### Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on F1 score, which are standard measures of prediction accuracy for classification and extraction problems.

Let GT = Ground truth value for a sample and OUT be output prediction from the model for a sample. Then we classify the predictions into one of the 4 classes with the following logic:

1. *True Positives* - If OUT != `""` and GT != `""` and OUT == GT
2. *False Positives* - If OUT != `""` and GT != `""` and OUT != GT
3. *False Positives* - If OUT != `""` and GT == `""`
4. *False Negatives* - If OUT == `""` and GT != `""`
5. *True Negatives* - If OUT == `""` and GT == `""`

Then, F1 score = 2*Precision*Recall/(Precision + Recall) where:

1. Precision = True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)
2. Recall = True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)

### Submission File

Upload a test_out.csv file in the Portal with the exact same formatting as sample_test_out.csv

## Smart Product Pricing Challenge

In e-commerce, determining the optimal price point for products is crucial for marketplace success and customer satisfaction. Your challenge is to develop an ML solution that analyzes product details and predict the price of the product. The relationship between product attributes and pricing is complex - with factors like brand, specifications, product quantity directly influence pricing. Your task is to build a model that can analyze these product details holistically and suggest an optimal price.

### Data Description:

The dataset consists of the following columns:

1. **sample_id:** A unique identifier for the input sample
2. **catalog_content:** Text field containing title, product description and an Item Pack Quantity(IPQ) concatenated.
3. **image_link:** Public URL where the product image is available for download.
   Example link - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XfHPR36-L.jpg
   To download images use `download_images` function from `src/utils.py`. See sample code in `src/test.ipynb`.
4. **price:** Price of the product (Target variable - only available in training data)

### Dataset Details:

- **Training Dataset:** 75k products with complete product details and prices
- **Test Set:** 75k products for final evaluation

### Output Format:

The output file should be a CSV with 2 columns:

1. **sample_id:** The unique identifier of the data sample. Note the ID should match the test record sample_id.
2. **price:** A float value representing the predicted price of the product.

Note: Make sure to output a prediction for all sample IDs. If you have less/more number of output samples in the output file as compared to test.csv, your output won't be evaluated.

### File Descriptions:

_Source files_

1. **src/utils.py:** Contains helper functions for downloading images from the image_link. You may need to retry a few times to download all images due to possible throttling issues.
2. **sample_code.py:** Sample dummy code that can generate an output file in the given format. Usage of this file is optional.

_Dataset files_

1. **dataset/train.csv:** Training file with labels (`price`).
2. **dataset/test.csv:** Test file without output labels (`price`). Generate predictions using your model/solution on this file's data and format the output file to match sample_test_out.csv
3. **dataset/sample_test.csv:** Sample test input file.
4. **dataset/sample_test_out.csv:** Sample outputs for sample_test.csv. The output for test.csv must be formatted in the exact same way. Note: The predictions in the file might not be correct

### Constraints:

1. You will be provided with a sample output file. Format your output to match the sample output file exactly.

2. Predicted prices must be positive float values.

3. Final model should be a MIT/Apache 2.0 License model and up to 8 Billion parameters.

### Evaluation Criteria:

Submissions are evaluated using **Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE)**: A statistical measure that expresses the relative difference between predicted and actual values as a percentage, while treating positive and negative errors equally.

**Formula:**

```
SMAPE = (1/n) * Σ |predicted_price - actual_price| / ((|actual_price| + |predicted_price|)/2)
```

**Example:** If actual price = $100 and predicted price = $120  
SMAPE = |100-120| / ((|100| + |120|)/2) \* 100% = 18.18%

**Note:** SMAPE is bounded between 0% and 200%. Lower values indicate better performance.

### Leaderboard Information:

- **Public Leaderboard:** During the challenge, rankings will be based on 25K samples from the test set to provide real-time feedback on your model's performance.
- **Final Rankings:** The final decision will be based on performance on the complete 75K test set along with provided documentation of the proposed approach by the teams.

### Submission Requirements:

1. Upload a `test_out.csv` file in the Portal with the exact same formatting as `sample_test_out.csv`

2. All participating teams must also provide a 1-page document describing:
   - Methodology used
   - Model architecture/algorithms selected
   - Feature engineering techniques applied
   - Any other relevant information about the approach
     Note: A sample template for this documentation is provided in Documentation_template.md
