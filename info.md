# INFO

Based on the problem, you have two inputs and one output:

- **Inputs**:
  1. **Image**: The product image, which contains visual information like dimensions, weight, wattage, etc.
  2. **Entity Name**: A textual descriptor indicating the type of information you need to extract from the image, such as "item_weight," "voltage," or "width."

- **Output**:
  - **Entity Value**: A string that combines a numerical value and a unit (e.g., "34 gram", "12.5 centimetre").

## The Flow of the Solution

The basic flow of your model can be outlined as follows:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Image**: Download the image using the provided URL and preprocess it. This might include resizing, normalizing, or augmenting the image.
   - **Entity Name**: Use the `entity_name` to identify what kind of information we're trying to extract (e.g., weight, height, voltage).

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **Image Feature Extraction**: Use a pre-trained vision model (such as ResNet, EfficientNet, or CLIP) to extract features from the image.
   - **Entity Name Encoding**: Convert the `entity_name` (a string) into a vector representation, either using embeddings (like Word2Vec, FastText, or BERT) or a one-hot encoding, to capture its meaning.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Combine Inputs**: Merge the image features and the entity name encoding in a joint model. This could be done by concatenating the image and text features and then passing them through fully connected layers.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The model should output the **entity value** (e.g., "34 gram", "12.5 centimetre").
   - This will involve predicting both a numerical value (e.g., "34") and the corresponding unit (e.g., "gram"). You can treat this as a sequence generation or classification task:
     - **For the numerical value**: Predict a regression output.
     - **For the unit**: Predict from a set of allowed units (e.g., "gram," "kilogram," "centimetre").

5. **Post-processing**:
   - Combine the predicted numerical value and unit into a valid output format (e.g., `"34 gram"`).

### Possible Model Architecture

Since you have two different inputs (image and text), a common architecture could be:

1. **Image Encoder**:
   - Use a pre-trained image model (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, or a model fine-tuned for feature extraction). This model takes the image as input and outputs a feature vector representing the image.

2. **Text Encoder**:
   - Use a language model or embedding technique (such as BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe) to encode the `entity_name`. This could be as simple as a one-hot encoding or a more sophisticated word embedding.

3. **Fusion Layer**:
   - Concatenate or merge the image features and the encoded `entity_name`. The merged representation can then be fed into a fully connected neural network to predict the final `entity_value`.

4. **Output Layer**:
   - The final layer could have two branches:
     - **Numerical Value Output**: Use a regression head to predict the numeric value.
     - **Unit Classification**: Use a softmax classifier to predict the unit from a predefined set (e.g., "gram," "centimetre").
